## Name of Student:  Jessi B

## Name of Project:  Tournament Tracker

Project's Purpose or Goal: 
* Allow user to create a bracket style tournament and track competitors via single elimation to a first place winner.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* Single level access - admin
* Adapted to jiujitsu competition
* Create bracket with variable competitors; use bye for odd number bracket
* Page to display dynamic bracket as matches progress

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* C# - backend
* React - frontend
* SQL
* JS
* HTML
* CSS

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Two level access - admin & competitor
* Multiple tournaments that would continue to build and track competitor stats
* Incorporate dynamic schedule to replicate real life tournaments
* Create multiple brackets per tournament based on competitor stats (gender, weight, skill & age)
* Create API with competitor stats

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Still exploring

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* I am looking into using C# backend & React front end but may fall back on just C# to meet MVP.
